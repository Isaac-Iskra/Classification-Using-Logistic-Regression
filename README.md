# Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression

The work done in the repository is from the book "Python: Machine Learning" by Wei-Meng Lee.  I do not own the rights to any of the contents.

In this repository, I learned about another supervised machine learning algorithm, logistic regression. I first learned about the logit function and how to transform it into a sigmoid function.  I thin applied the logistic regression to the breast cancer dataset and used it show if a tumor is malignant or benign based on the measurment of the tumor.
